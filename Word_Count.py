            "with a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardels bear, "

            "and makes us rather bear those ills we have, "
            "than fly to others that we know not of. "

            "and thus the native hue of Resolution"
            "Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought, "
            "And enterprises of great pitch and moment, "
            "with this regard their Currents turn awry, "
            "And lose the name of Action. Soft you now, "
